recommended by Lay-it-out? (5 means the most difficult)",5.Which approach do you think is better?,6. Explain why the aforementioned approach is better.
1,4,1,,1,,,5,3,2,"The tool can help me find the ambiguous sentences and parse tree, it's hard to think about this manually."
2,4,1,,1,,,5,3,2,"Mainly, it can help to detect whether the grammar is ambiguous or not, while manually doing so is hard."
3,5,,,1,,1,4,3,2,Students who are not familiar with compilers can be instructed in disambiguation. 
4,4,1,,1,,,4,2,2,(The tool) can give strong evidence of unambiguity.
5,3,1,,1,,,5,1,2,"You can let the tool automatically reason about ambiguity, and you can narrow down the choice of constraints; doing grammar refinement manually is error-prone, difficult to check, and less confident in the results."
6,3,,,1,,,4,4,2,"Functionally, using tool is a superset of manual operations."
7,3,,,1,,,3,3,2,"The options provided by the tool are often not too accurate, and many times still have to rely on an understanding of the top-level design, but it makes sense to help find counter-examples."
8,3,,,1,,1,5,2,2,"You can give a more accurate recommendation on the location of the constraint to be added (for example, it does not have a recommended location for the time being without tangling); it is also relatively easier to choose the specific constraint based on the recommendation plus user's intuition."
